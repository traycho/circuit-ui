# Getting started

## Creating a new app with Circuit UI

The quickest way to bootstrap a new project with Circuit UI is using [`create-sumup-react-app`](https://github.com/sumup/create-sumup-react-app). It will create a fresh project based on [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and will use Circuit UI and SumUp's [Foundry](https://github.com/sumup/foundry) JavaScript toolkit.

#### Prerequisites

- You should have **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** installed at a version equal or above **`v9.10.0`**.
- At the moment this project reqires **[`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/)** to be installed on your system. Yarn is a package manager for JavaScript. You can read how to install the Yarn CLI in [their documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).
- You will need **`npx`** installed. It is bundled with `npm` v5.2 and up. Alternatively, you can run `yarn global add npx` or `npm install -g npx` to manually install it.

#### Installation

Open your terminal and navigate to the directory you would like to place your project in. Then run the following command where `my-app` is the name of your project:

```bash
yarn create @sumup/sumup-react-app my-app
# Or if you prefer npx:
npx @sumup/create-sumup-react-app my-app
```

This will create the folder `my-app` and initialize a new project inside.

## Adding Circuit UI to an existing app

You can install Circuit UI via `yarn` or `npm`. In your current project directory, run the following command:

```bash
yarn add @sumup/circuit-ui
# Or if you prefer npm:
npm install @sumup/circuit-ui
```

Circuit UI relies on some mandatory peer dependencies, namely [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion), our CSS-in-JS library. You should install them with the following command:

```bash
yarn add react react-dom @emotion/core @emotion/styled emotion-theming
# Or if you prefer npm:
npm install react react-dom @emotion/core @emotion/styled emotion-theming
```

## Using Circuit UI without React

<Status.Experimental />

Projects that can't or don't use React can still benefit from Circuit UI. They can use the styles by extracting the plain CSS from the components. Read more in the [Static CSS documentation](Styles|Static-CSS).
